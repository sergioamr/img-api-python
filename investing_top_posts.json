Need to keep this locked to spare my inbox.\n\nE4: 2:27pm and it looks like RH and a few other brokerages are still not allowing investors to buy certain stocks.

Personally I'm not going to suggest brokerages that did this when anyone asks for brokerage recommendations on here in the future. Not that I really recommended RH for ages anyways, but apparently going forward it's Fidelity and Etrade when people ask I guess.\n\nYou're talking about the head of the Nasdaq saying that trading in situations like GME should be paused so that pros can \"recalibrate?\" When my investments toilet, can I get a trade halt? \n\nAs others have noted, this basically confirms a lot of what WSB have been saying. \n\nIs this some attempt for firms to try to \"protect\" people? Some people will end up losing big in this whole thing and that's unfortunate, but even if so, can't start stopping trading (what's the rules-based exact reason why RH is not allowing trading in these names?) because once you do it it's a slippery slope - what becomes, \"too much, gotta stop trading\"?\n\nI tell people on here that you're going to make mistakes and you have to learn from your errors and over time you hopefully evolve into a better investor. Apparently, when major funds make real mistakes, they don't have to learn from their mistakes, they yell for the ref to halt the game. When this GME squeeze is over (and it will be at some point - it isn't going to infinity), some people are going to be the bagholders and that's unfortunate but my question is, when GME reverses and there's volatility to the downside, will the same brokerages halt trading in these names again or no?\n\nWhether you are for what WSB did or not, I think everyone can agree that this \"rules for me but not for thee.\"  And maybe that's the way things are going to be and people have to adapt, but it's still pretty dismaying.\n\nIf this somehow shows how broken the system is (i don't think it's going to cause some sort of market crash, it will stop sooner than later), then that was going to happen eventually anyways.\n\nEdited because high and holy crap, some errors.\n\nEDIT: LOL.

                "body": "saw this on wsb:\n\n \n\nSo today is all about psychological warfare. First they restricted people on RH and IB and others from trading then they orchestrated what seemed like a huge sell off.\n\nIf you look at the volume, this actually didn't happen though and was all just fake. To understand you need to know how they come up with the price in the chart. Basically if somebody sells a stock for $150 dollar, that's your new value in the chart. So basically what they do is, they sell at 300, then at 299, then 298, and so on. They take on a huge risk by doing this because of course they increase their short positions. They did this a lot in the last couple of days, but today they did it three times in a row pushing the price as low as $120. They were hoping that enough people on Reddit and IB would panic sell (because they're unexperienced) and then are unable to buy back once they realize it was all just for show.\n\nNow the thing that saved the day is that at this point this is not just retail investors. At this point there is other institutional investors involved and of course they immediately saw through tnis, waited it out and now pushed the price right back above 200.\n\nWhy 200 you might ask. The highest call that was sold is 200. They're all in the money and some of them expire Friday. What will happen is that whoever sold them needs to buy 100 shares and give them to the call holder. So basically this will lead to very high demand at very limited supply. In fact higher demand than could ever possibly be supplied.\n\nThe real short squeeze hasn't happened. It happened today right before the big drop. I know now what it looks like. Straight up, no dips at all. It went up to 420.69, stayed there for a while (because many people set that as a sell price), then went straight to 444.44 (because people like this number too) and so on. They realized how screwed they are and pulled off their last strategy.\n\nAll day I said why isn't SEC stepping in, this is clear market manipulation, but I realize now why. This is even bigger than I thought. The broker is responsible for making sure their clients don't lose too much money, i.e. by margin calling them. Now Melvin capitals broker (who by the way owns 40% of robin hood, sees all their transactions and orders and of course was expected to influence them in this way) knows, that if they margin call melvin, they will not be able to cover the cost. So who will pay the rest? If I understand correctly it is the broker who has to pay the rest. I don't know who that broker is and how they're set up, but they will basically go bankrupt immediately and they might have a huge amount of funds in them suddenly being unable to pay out to their other clients. If this will happen, then a global market crash is almost guaranteed.\n\nSo the SEC isn't stepping in, because they don't want this short squeeze to happen. For decades, hedge funds pushed for very loose regulation. Now they've maneuvered themselves into a position of truly infinite loss. I mean at one point I'm very proud of reddit they figured out the loophole, but it's also scary.\n\nI really don't know at this point, what will happen if the squeeze truly happens.\n\nGiven how this battle was fought so far, there's probably more dirty tactics coming.",

It was created in response to the sketchy shit banks did during the mortgage crisis, and what we're seeing this week is just replaying all of that.  The hedge funds are clearly coordinating with brokers to protect their short position.  If you had the same short position, they'd have no problem taking you for all you're worth.  But if they short it - time to shut down buying to suppress the price.  Time to get the media to paint the retail investors as right wing extremists, or as fools who are going to hurt themselves when the opposite is true.  Time to make fake claims of closing out their short positions to instill fear.  Time to trade to each other after hours and during buying halts to make the price look like it's falling on very low volume restricted trading.  But what it's never time for them to do - own up to the fact that they used YOUR money to open extremely risky short positions to try make themselves rich.\n\nCrypto has the power to end all of that.  A decentralized system means everybody plays by the same rules, and everybody can hold their own money if they want to.  No more giving your cash to banks to enable them to manipulate the system in their favor by bending or breaking the rules in ways that you can't.  I hope the one thing that people get out of this blatant abuse of the system is a realization that this isn't the first time it's happened, it won't be the last, and it's the exact reason cryptocurrencies exist.",

Well, they just booted the cheapest passengers while assaulting one of them. Combine that with a history of bad experiences and I don't see how they're going to fix this one without months of damage control. Or, at the very least, a lot of heads on pikes.\n\nMy thesis is that it's likely that this isn't another broken guitar. No, I think it's another Chipotle or Ratner. Here's why;\n\n  * **Because he's the perfect victim.** *Elderly* Doctor on the way to tend to his patients is assaulted by jack booted thugs. They went after the one (?) person on that plane who could elicit universal empathy and had a valid, pressing reason to keep his seat.\n\n  * **Because there's blood.** The fact that he was harmed is immediate and visible. There aren't any follow-on reports that need to be tacked on to emphasise the seriousness of the incident. He was an elderly man who had blood dripping from his mouth.\n\n  * **Because he's a part of at least two powerful consumer groups.** Doctors (and nurses) are a powerful lobby, who look out for their own. And are still the most respected profession in the US and the world. Then there's the Chinese/Asian consumers angle.\n\n  * **Because the incident's imagery is almost the perfect set of triggers for mass outrage.** The video had a giant corporation ruining the life of someone vital to American society. Check. It had a literal jack-booted thug. Check. Said thug took something from the person/violated the integrity of their personal space/freedom over a seemingly trivial issue. Triple Check. The upstanding member of society wasn't at fault. Check.\n\nI can't see United making this work without a lot of blood letting.",

He had a fuck off nice apt in the city, and a glamorous French gf. He didn’t parle français, not one damn word. He was living really, really well. I asked him when he was going to sell?\n\n[blank look] “are you kidding? Never! *I’m retired*. Big self satisfied grin.\n\nI’m a stocks-and-real-estate kinda guy and I think I halfheartedly tried to convince him to maybe sell some and buy a flat in Europe after such a big run up, but he wasn’t having it. Bitcoin was “just now being discovered by the masses and is on its way to 100k”\n\nI think about him sometimes. Hope he’s doing good",

In other words, someone who buys in the morning and holds gets to enjoy the overnight growth just as much as someone who bought right before close. So, you don't get any advantage by placing orders at the end of the day instead of the beginning.\n\nAlso, while this statistic is surprising, it's not as crazy as it sounds. There are only 6.5 trading hours per business day. Adjusting for holidays, there are 253 trading days per year, so 1644 trading hours. There are 8760 total hours in a year, so only 19% of total time is during trading hours. Thus, we'd expect 80% of the gains would happen outside trading hours anyway. It's surprising that it's \"100%\", but still not as crazy as it sounds at first glance.",

Eventually I sold to “lock in gains” but figured I could get back in at a similar price before it jumped up too much again.\n\nThe problem was that the majority of the big gains occurred before the market even opened and I could never get back in at my selling price.\n\nIt has happened at other times with almost every stock I have invested in.  When you see a stock that “went up 20% today”, most people don’t realize that most, if not all, of the gains happened before the market even opened but to the amateur investor it seems like you could have made 20% if you had bought in the morning.  No, you would have made 20% if you had bought yesterday afternoon.\n\nAlthough I didn’t get into GME, I watched the charts a lot and saw the same thing happening.  When GME was going up, it was actually very easy to lose money when trading intraday because the stock would rocket during premarket and aftermarket but would mostly wobble during the trading day.  To make money, you really needed to hold overnight.\n\nAfter my observations, I realized I need to hold my stocks overnight to experience any really significant gains so it pretty much turned me off from day trading altogether.  I typically find that the more often I trade, the more I lose.  When I trade less often, it becomes easier to make gains and I think this is the reason.",

The best time to sell when rising is usually mid to after hours, but we are talking guessing the exact right day and hour to maximize. The best time to sell falling is not to sell, but to go long and sit on it.\n\nHonestly, I would almost always go with a limit than a time.

These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.\"\n\n“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.\"\n\n\"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.\"\n\n\"Who cares about the fundamentals?

It's a play called a \"short ladder\" (I'm new to all of this but hell if I'm not learning a ton these last few weeks!)I'm still baffled at how disgusting these moves are... and I'd wager it's far from over.\n\nEdit to add what short ladder attack is:\n\nSay price of XYZ stock is $400/share.\n\nHedge A sells shares of XYZ stock to Hedge B for $390. Hedge B sells shares of XYZ stock back to Hedge A for $380. They ping pong back and forth on an extremely rapid pace, making it appear that the new price per share is far lower than the market value previously was. This spooks the hell out of people who are worried about losing their entire investment and they sell (probably at a loss), Hedges scoop up shares they've shaken out and the price rises back to it's regular level when they're done.",

Most of the top companies will exploit and underpay foreign labour to remain competitive. Most of your bosses didn't get their positions because of their talent but often because of their connections or money.\n\nI could go on, but my point is that life isn't fair and while it's a noble societal endeavor to try to make things fairer, as an individual if you want to compete at the top 1% percent at anything in life you need to identify and be willing to exploit your unfair advantages.\n\nI'm not even saying people shouldn't be mad at this, but just don't be surprised to find out stuff like this is happening because it will make you a bitter person. Life isn't fair and it never will be. It's actually surprising to me that an investment community is shocked by this. The reason Reddit won their battle this week is because they used their unfair advantage as one of the largest communities on the internet to orchestrate a global movement to attack a few random hedgefunds. You think I as an individual can screw over a hedge fund like Reddit did this week? Nope, and perhaps that's not fair either, but it was pragmatic. And that's all that really matters.",

Does this reflect reality at all hedge funds? Was he a bad manager who had to resort to this? He sounds bitter and cynical (and possibly high) - is he painting a grimmer picture than actual reality because that’s in his nature? He doesn’t exactly strike me as someone who I could count on for a balanced and comprehensive take (now or back when this was filmed).",

He's not a licensed financial advisor. \n\nI’m surprise this isn’t more well known.\n\nYou have to also understand that he ran a hedge fund during a very different time. This is how hedge funds were back then. He even mentions the good old days of hedge funds on air, and this is what he’s referring to. \n\nHedge funds often serve a different purpose now, and it’s not always to beat the s&p as what he’s referring to in this video.\n\nWe still have the likes of them to an extent, and many still deal in high risk, borderline illegal, and highly unethical practices, but you have to understand that unless you go full Enron, Madoff, or even just pull a Martha Stewart, you’re usually not looking at possible time in jail. If the losses can’t be tied to a Ponzi scheme where you’re robbing your own clients, or making illegal sales from your own company, it’s a very grey area that some people consider to be just part of how things work. \n\nIf you stick to something like VTI, VT, and so forth, all of this is a nothing blip in the infinite variability of the entire market, and shouldn’t cause you more harm than any one who isn’t a speculator. \n\nJust remember, Jim is there for entertainment. If you’re getting your investment ideas for picking individual stocks from CNBC and not a reputable financial advisor, you’re going to butt heads with these people. If buy and hold in good companies is your plan, and you limit speculating to a very small fraction of your worth, these issues are mostly irrelevant. \n\nAnyways, he's an actor. He says he reads Reddit (Wall Street bets) regularly, and we all know that's a lie, aside from maybe an intern showing him a post or two.\n\nBasically, CNBC is not a good source for speculative trading advice. The guy literally hates on ETFs one day, and in the next breath tries to qualify his opinion by saying that yes, the broad ETFs are something everyone should own some of....\n\nJim is also NOT licensed in any form that I'm aware of, regarding financial advice. He also graduated from Harvard law and passed the board, but he's not a lawyer. Keep in mind that he is 100% not there to make your rich. He's there to sell advertising spots.",

New Jersey has demanded that Uber pay $649 million for years of unpaid employment taxes for its drivers, arguing that the ride-hailing company has misclassified the workers as independent contractors and not as employees.\n\nA audit uncovered $530 million in back taxes that had not been paid for unemployment and disability insurance from 2014 to 2018. Because of the nonpayment, the state is seeking another $119 million in interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/nyregion/uber-new-jersey-drivers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/nyregion/uber-new-jersey-drivers.html)",

On top of that, most drivers report financial improvement because of Uber (and I suspect, many of the drivers are immigrants who have an easier path to income with Uber).\n\nWhat prevents them from being honest independent workers in my mind is that they aren’t told the details of the ride before they take it on. Any independent contractor in my mind agrees on the job being performed with a company before the work is done. If Uber wants to use independent contractors instead of employees, go for it, but you can’t also not tell them in advance what the contract entails.",

The driver of the Uber is taxed on his income as a driver, and there is probably another tax or two that I am not seeing.  \n\nThen, NJ wants more than a Half-Billion dollars in taxes from a company that loses billions of dollars a year as it is - This seems like a pretty unsustainable model.\n\nAnd it is.\n\nBut of course we know that Uber and others are working on self driving cars, and there doesn't seem to be any resistance to them from either the government or the populous, so they are pretty much an inevitability.\n\nWhere does that leave the Uber driver? (unemployed)  What happens to the income they paid the state from being a driver? (cease to exist) And what happens to the other taxes the Uber driver paid? ( no job = no income related taxes)\n\nOnce all the human drivers are replaced with automated human transport vehicles then Uber will have a completely different business model. I think they are counting on a shift to this model. Once this happens, taxation will be of a different type - most likely based on the numbers that Uber produces internally (R&D costs, robot devaluations, etc) rather than hard numbers like labor hours and employee benefit credits, etc.,\n\nwe also see from past American history that quite often large monopoly like corporations pay very little or no taxes on huge profits. I'm sure Uber would love to attain this status.\n\nThe point of part or all of this post is to point out that heavy taxation and antiquated laws are going to push the future in perhaps unwanted or unintended directions, human obsolescence being one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToo much taxation / regulation = Uber fails and the next Uber-like company rises to take it's place.....\n\nToo much automation and human drivers are irrelevant, upending all types of taxes and industries.  Point to ponder - If Uber came into NJ and \"fired\" all of their human drivers and replaced them with auto-cars, and the drivers all went to the NJ for unemployment insurance, would NJ then argue that they were \"independent contractors\" and deny their claims? I bet they would...\n\nSO....\n\n***Do you invest solely for returns?***\n\n***Would you invest in a technology that you want to see advanced solely to see it advance (regardless of gains or lo$$es)?***\n\n***What if you knew the technology was going to make a lot of skilled or semi-skilled workers  irrelevant?***\n\n***Would you invest in a technology if you thought that the current laws and taxations in place could really cause unwanted social effects if the technology were to thrive?

        "text": "First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments. \n\nI'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week.  A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n>Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n>But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n>[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n>Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n>What do you make of that? One reading would be: “Retail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they’re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.” Or as one Twitter user put it, “past the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.”\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.  Go buy like a hundredth of a share of VTI or something.",

Still hoping for a paradigm shift, still seeing plenty of reasonable-to-intelligent sounding vloggers, bloggers and Redditors making a case for GME. Not willing to throw in more then I already have (which I am OK, if a little sad) about losing.\n\nThe rational side of me sort of assumes this will flame itself out, but that's exactly what my rational brain would have said before the 2008 crash if a handful of people online started screaming about the impending subprime mortgage crisis months before 'everyone else' seemed aware of it.\n\nThis is addictive, though. The rage, the vulgarity...the perception of having power you probably don't actually have. Must feel quite a bit like what those Q-Anon loonies went through on their descent down the rabbit hole.\n\nI see things like the VIX moving in seeming correlation with GME, Goldman's alleged warning (though I can't see that anywhere but ZH and have no idea what was actually said), a bit of a big tech selling off (so desperate shorts can cover, of course!) and my gut says these brokers messed up...they're still bleeding...still desperate, and the squeeze thesis remains valid if shares remain out of their reach.\n\nEven the Citadel news above; their verbiage seems confusing...graf says retail were net buyers Monday and sellers the rest of the week. But then it references the number of buy orders and sell orders, which if I'm not completely insane with conspiracy right now, seems like a different figure. If buy orders averaged 10 shares per trade and sell orders averaged 3 - which would kind of be in line with what I'm doing myself to lower risk while staying engaged - there might be a 50/50 split in the number of orders but considerably more shares would be staying in retail hands.\n\nTL;DR: This is insane and out of an abundance of caution anyone going all-in who isn't at least considering an exist strategy should be.",

Last I checked short interest is still over 100% and trading volume is more than the float itself.",

Also at my first job the owner's wife swore off owning stocks because she also put all of her money in Nortel stock and lost everything.\n\nI was pretty interested in following the month by month recap of the .com bubble when I was in College, that was before I had any disposable income. I loved investing from 2003 to 2018 because with some research you could find good stocks at good prices with upside (my largest single stock was MSFT from 2009 to 2018, other than that mostly ETF, zero bonds).\n\nI really hate today's market. Normalized insanity. I blame the central banks mostly for the everything bubble. Would you loan someone that makes 100k per year 700k to buy a house at 2.8% interest, or you would rather invest the money elsewhere? No one would do the loan, interest rates not being priced by markets is the root cause of all this shit.",

                "body": "I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that a big portion of the hype around the GME shit is desperation, my dude. Wealth inequality is at its highest since the Victorian era; we live in literally Dickensian times and a hell of a lot of folks are keenly aware that they're not going to escape their meagre lot without a miracle. If you're born with nothing or nearly nothing, it's a 99.99999% sure bet that you'll die with nothing or nearly nothing. The capitalist mantra that your efforts will pay off if you just work hard enough and make the most of opportunities just isn't ringing true for a lot of us, especially in the US and the UK. I know it isn't for me. \n\nI bought a handful of GME for a sum that I figured would be fair a little way down the line if GameStop itself picks up and becomes successful again. It's just brought in a new CEO who has experience with online retail and they're talking about heaps of new ideas to modernise the brand and make it relevant in the current era, e.g., custom PC building in-store. I don't believe it's as doomed as a lot of folks are saying and I don't believe that it's entirely bereft of a future. I think it's going to make a comeback, and that's the metric I used to decide how much I'd be willing to pay for a share as a new investor, a beginner. I'm bullish on GME. \n\n(Incidentally, it's also why I didn't buy any AMC, even though the price point is so much lower. Cinemas and movie theatres have been propped up by the sales of snacks like popcorn for literally a hundred years at this point, and it's only getting worse with the, I don't remember the correct word but like publishers except with movies, with them holding theatres over a barrel and charging ridiculously high prices for blockbusters during opening weeks when the theatres have little choice but to pay if they want to make any money at all. Between that and the rise of Netflix and the like, the cinema or movie theatre, as an industry, is dying, in my opinion. I don't see a future in AMC, or any of my more local cinema companies like Cineworld.) \n\nBut I won't lie to you. I'm desperate. I'm disabled, and I spend fully 25% of the non-refundable hours of my life grappling with the DWP - roughly six months out of every two years battling with assessments, denials of benefit and then the inevitable appeals circus - even though my condition is long-term, very possibly permanent. I live in social housing that I'm terrified could be sold out from under me at any time, and because I'm claiming benefit and the waiting lists for social housing are longer than ever, no private landlord will so much as look at me and I'd be homeless in a heartbeat. I'm trying to write a book, but you don't get paid for that until the work is already done in its entirety (if someone likes it enough to pay you for it!), and even that is a moonshot made out of pure, miserable despair. I'm tired, suffering and afraid, and the billion to one chance that the GME hype does pay off and I manage to scrape some significant profit from it appeals to me in a horrible way that I'm sure you can probably appreciate. I want to *escape.* \n\nI can't be the only one.\n\nAt least in my case, the way I see it, I either get very lucky indeed sometime this month and I can move back to the town where I actually want to live with enough money to buy a modest home for myself that I can't be run out of by someone with more money than me, or, on the other hand, I get a little bit lucky in five years or so and I'll have some extra cash that I can pull out to tide me over the next time my benefits get cut for a few months. Others are probably not as grounded as me, and that's saying a lot, considering *my* position.",

It's clear that there have been coordinated efforts to short-ladder the stock down on low volume and snipe retail stop loss limits. Couple this with the fact that brokers like etoro are locking in automatic stop loss orders the require collateral to deactivate, and you've got a clear reason why retail investors last week were (barely) heavy on the sell-side. \n\nI mean come on, man - RH deactivated an entire list of securities that people aren't allowed to buy. You really want to look at the buy/sell #'s from retail LAST WEEK and take any of it at face value? I get that this trade, at this point, is complete and total speculation and people need to understand that and mitigate their risk accordingly.

But with this stock and the way it's gone about, it's pretty hard not to involve emotions, because of the revelation and education that it brought to so many people about the market, hedge funds, and the highly manipulated platform that is trading, with little to no regulation for wealthy; GME being shorted 134% is proof of that.

That was something very obvious to technically inclined folks back in the 2000s, but big tech prettified their products enough to get todays young people on board.\n\nNearly everything now is subscription based purely to extract more money from the consumer for little additional utility. E.g. you could actually own Adobe products several years back, now if you want to photoshop anything you better pay that subscription. Shit, you could own your Microsoft Office suite back in 2013. What about now? And the trend is only accelerating.\n\nAnd its the same story with a lot of the fancy fin-tech products geared towards the younger investor.",

There are legitimate reasons driving this. However as you say, reality is no longer in phase with the hype train.

In all likelihood it goes further than moral apathy - send most likely that they have done the math on Microtransactions and decided the gains are too good to consider the impact that gambling has on children.\n\nTo me, microtransactions - loot boxes in particular - have become societal cancer. Loot boxes are completely without a moral compass, like selling cigarettes to teenagers. I have no problem with skins and shaders for $1 $10 whatever, but selling a scratch ticket and calling it \"content\" is dishonest and predatory. ",
